## Version 1.15 (Aug 21, 2013)

Includes support for ads in the MRAID 2.0 format. MRAID 2.0 allows advertisers to create ads with rich media functionality, including adding calendar events, storing pictures and playing videos in the native video player. To learn more about MRAID 2.0, read our [help article](http://j.mp/16MKSci).

  - Added the following MRAID 2.0 features: `createCalendarEvent` (Android 4.0 and above), `playVideo`, `storePicture`, and `supports`
  - Hardware Acceleration is now enabled by default for `MraidInterstitial`s on Android 4.0 and above  
  - Ensured that Cursors in `FacebookKeywordProvider` are always closed properly; fixes [GitHub issue #8](https://github.com/mopub/mopub-android-sdk/issues/8)  
  - Added tracking parameter to InMobi ad requests; fixes [GitHub issue #15](https://github.com/mopub/mopub-android-sdk/issues/15)  
  - Banner WebViews are now removed from the view hierarchy before they are destroyed; fixes [GitHub issue #23](https://github.com/mopub/mopub-android-sdk/issues/23)  

To correctly display ads that ask the user to save a picture (storePicture ads), you need to make the following change to AndroidManifest.xml:  
* Add the`WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission. Note: **Adding the permission is optional**. If the permission is not added, we will not deliver any store picture ads to the users' devices. All other features will remain functional without the new permission. 

To allow users to play videos using the native video player:  
* Declare activity `com.mopub.mobileads.MraidVideoPlayerActivity`. This activity is required to support playing videos in the native player and we strongly recommend adding it.
