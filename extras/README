Google AdSense SDK
==================
Although the AdSense SDK for Android is deprecated, you can support it by doing the following:

1) Copy AdSenseAdapter.java under the extras/ folder to mopub-android-sdk/src/com/mopub/mobileads
2) Place the Google AdSense SDK in mopub-android-sdk/libs
3) Add GoogleAdView.jar to the Java Build Path in the Properties section of mopub-android-sdk.

*NOTE: At this time, Google does not allow distribution of GoogleAdView.jar so you will need to get that file from Google
